#### Requirements and installation guide
```
Step 1: pip install scikit-learn
Step 2: pip install tensorflow
Step 3: Run the following jupyter notebook file:
 For Upgraded Random Forest: Upgraded_NextDay-RF.ipynb
 For Upgraded LSTM: Modified_NextDay-LSTM.ipynb
 For New Feature i.e. MLP: Added_new_model_MLP_Next_Day.ipynb
Step 4: Once the notebook all cell is successfully executed, it shows all the results and outputs.
